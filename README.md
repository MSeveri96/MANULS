# Optimal External Electric Field

A program to calculate the external electric field that makes a chemical reaction barrierless.

This first version of the code works with 1-D and  2-D scans of the potential energy surface.

## Documentation 

You can find the documentation, along with some examples, [here](https://github.com/MSeveri96/Optimal-external-electric-field/blob/main/Documentation/README.md) or, if you prefer, download a PDF version with this [link]

## Prerequisites
The script has been tested with:
1. Python 3.8
2. Numpy 1.19.5
3. Matplotlib 3.3.4 (optional)

Usually the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries can be installed using the `pip` or `pip3` (for python3) package. 

For instance: `pip install numpy matplotlib`

## Installation and Usage

It is sufficient to download the code and run the script. 

`python oeef_2d.py` or `python oeef_1d.py` depending on the number of variables scanned.
