# Optimal External Electric Field

This simple repository contains the script used to find the Optimal External Electric Field (OEEF) to make the Wittig reaction barrierless, as described in xx-xx-xx. This code also calculates the Optimal Bond Breaking Point (OBBP). The OBBP is a special point of the potential energy surface. If the system is in the OBBP and is perturbed with the OEFF the reaction becomes barrierless.

This first version of the code works with 2-D scans of the potential energy surface.
